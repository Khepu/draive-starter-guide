## Task Management

We use trello as our main task overview/management tool. Feel free to create, or
add yourself to a ticket after being assigned the relevant task by the repo
manager.

## Technical Questions

We encourage developers to use our stack teams board, as this makes sure we can
easily reference to relevant answers if similar issues arise in the future.
