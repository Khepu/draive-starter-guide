<img id="intro-logo" src="./logo.png" alt="drawing" />

Building a self-driving car is no joke, and we take it very seriously! Being organized is our most important tool in dealing with the complexity of the project.
This page should provide a good grasp of our workflow, or at least the parts that are common across draive. After reading it, you should feel comfortable enough with our naming conventions, know where to find new tasks, and where to ask for help.

This guide assumes some familiarity with git, StackOverflow, and Trello.
