<h3 id="branches-and-commits">Branches and Commits</h3>
<p>We usually branch off either the <code>master</code> or the <code>develop</code> branch, based on weather or not they are directly pushing to a produciton server. Make sure to inquire about which is considered the main working branch on the repo you want to work on.</p>
<p>Every major or otherwise significant task is assigned its own branch. Upon completion of said task, the developer should open a pull request towards the branch from which they branched off and wait for a review by the person in charge of the repo.</p>
<p>Within the branch, frequent, small commits are encouraged as they provide extremely valuable insight to our code.</p>
<h3 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>We use 4 standard prefixes for our branch names and our commit names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>feature</code>: a significant addition to the codebase.</li>
<li><code>refactor</code>: a significant alteration of the codebase.</li>
<li><code>bugfix</code>: a correction of a bug, warning, error or similar issue .</li>
<li><code>chore</code>: a minor addition or alteration (used only for commit names since branches should contain significant changes).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When creating a branch use the following naming scheme</strong></p>
<pre><code>prefix/short-description</code></pre>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<pre><code>feature/add-authentication
refactor/bars-to-foos
bugfix/fix-critical-issue</code></pre>
<p><strong>When commiting to changes, use the following naming scheme</strong></p>
<pre><code>prefix: short description</code></pre>
<p><em>Examples:</em></p>
<pre><code>Feature: add address field to users table
Refactor: bar to foo
Bugfix: correct compiler warning
Chore: clean up section</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: While branch prefixes should always start with a lowercase letter, the same isnt required on commits. Branch names are used by git to organize branches in a repo, while commit names are used to to quickly describe the commit’s purpose to a reviewer or other developer. Thus, when naming commits, exact typography isnt a concern.</em></p>
<p><strong>When unsure of the correct branch or commit name, follow these steps</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Think of exactly what you did or are about to do.</li>
<li>Based on step 1, pick the prefix that describes the purpose of your branch/commit</li>
<li>Based on step 1, describe your exact additions or changes in as few words as possible, always focusing on <strong>what</strong> you did and not <strong>why</strong> or <strong>how</strong> you did it.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, if you’re unsure of the correct approach, use one of the contact options listed bellow to inquire about your next steps.</p>

<h3 id="task-management">Task Management</h3>
<p>We use trello as our main task overview/management tool feel free to create, or add yourself to a ticket after being assigned the relevant task by the repo manager.</p>
<p><em>Check it out <a href="https://trello.com/b/aF0ekxsf/draive">here</a></em></p>
<h3 id="technical-questions">Technical Questions</h3>
<p>We encourage developers to use our stack teams board, as this makes sure we can easily reference to relevant answers if similar issues arise in the future.</p>
<p><em>Check it out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/c/draive/questions">here</a></em></p>
<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>
<p>Our discord server is the main communication tool between all team members. Feel free to use any channel of interest</p>
