# Branches and Commits

We usually branch off either the `master` or the `develop` branch, based on
whether or not they are directly pushing to a produciton server. Make sure to
inquire about which is considered the main working branch on the repo you want
to work on.

Every major or otherwise significant task is assigned its own branch. Upon
completion of said task, the developer should open a pull request towards the
branch from which they branched off and wait for a review by the person in
charge of the repo.

Within the branch, frequent, small commits are encouraged as they provide
extremely valuable insight to our code.
